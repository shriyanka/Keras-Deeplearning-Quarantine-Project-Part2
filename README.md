# Keras-Deeplearning-Quarntine-Project2

I worked on this project as extension to my previous project <a href="https://github.com/shriyanka/Keras-Deeplearning-Quarantine-Project-Part1"><b>Keras-Deeplearning-Quarantine-Project-Part1</b></a>. 
Again, wrote all the code from scratch and trained multi class deeplearning model end to end on 10 class image dataset. 
Primary focus was to achieve a better accuracy higher than 82.8. This time I used transfer learning to boost up the accuracy on same data set.
The model used was InceptionResNetV2. Played with Inception, ResNet50, but finally chose this.

Accuracy achieved - 95%
